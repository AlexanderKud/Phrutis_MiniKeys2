For RTX 3060, 3070, 3080</br>
Run: ```MiniKeys2-30xx.exe -bits 24 -a addresses.txt -d 0```</br>

For RTX 3090, A100, A5000, A6000</br>
Run: ```MiniKeys2-30xx.exe -bits 25 -a addresses.txt -d 0```<hr>

### Extra options

-d ? - Card number</br>
-a ? - Name of BTC address database 1.., 3.., bc... on a new line</br>
-id ? - Telegram bot chat number</br>
-bot ? - bot token (create your bot)</br>

### :memo: Frequently Asked Questions<hr>
Where to download the program, how to run it?</br>

[**HERE**](https://github.com/phrutis/MiniKeys2/releases/tag/1.0)<hr>

Where can I download the database of OLD BTC addresses 1... ?</br>

[**HERE**](https://github.com/phrutis/MiniKeys2/releases/tag/1.0)<hr>

Where to download 4907 addresses of coins series1?</br>

[**HERE**](https://github.com/phrutis/MiniKeys2/blob/main/Others/serie1.txt)<hr>

How many physical coins were issued and which ones?</br>

61,560 coins. List of all addresses from coins and other information [**HERE**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phrutis/MiniKeys2/main/Others/Fullist.txt)<hr> 

Does the program require an internet connection?</br>
If you use a telegram bot - Yes</br>
If you just search, you don't need internet.<hr>

I launched the program hung (froze) what should I do?</br>

The program needs time to create the table.</br>
Wait for start:</br>
For 23 bits = 20 minutes</br>
For 24 bits = 25 minutes</br>
For 25 bits = 35 minutes</br>
For 26 bits = 45 minutes<hr>

If I find the private key can I take all the coins for myself?</br>

No, you will find the encrypted key.</br>
Only the organizers  can decrypt this key and pay you a 50%.<hr>

I have a RTX 3060 TI card, and I have a low speed, how can speed up?</br>

In the new drivers for 30xx Ti, 20xx Ti, a limiter is installed that slows down the speed by half.</br>
You need to download the old driver from six months ago. 496.13</br>
Delete the new driver, install the old driver, the speed will increase x2</br>
After searching, you can install new drivers.<hr>

I have many GPUs. How to start?

Run each GPU separately. Add your card id -d ?</br>
Run: ```MiniKeys2-30xx.exe -bits 24 -a addresses.txt -d 0```</br>
Run: ```MiniKeys2-30xx.exe -bits 24 -a addresses.txt -d 1```</br>
Run: ```MiniKeys2-30xx.exe -bits 24 -a addresses.txt -d 2```</br>
Run: ```MiniKeys2-30xx.exe -bits 24 -a addresses.txt -d 3```</br>
Run: ```MiniKeys2-30xx.exe -bits 24 -a addresses.txt -d 4```</br></br>
To run one gpu in ```MiniKeys2``` you need 4-6 GB of RAM!</br>
If you are low on RAM, use the ```M30xx``` program.</br>
It only needs 500 MB of RAM to run.<hr>

Why didn't you do a Serie2 30 character minikey search?</br>

These are new coins (2013)</br>
Very large search range.</br>
Many coins are nominal, the amounts are small.</br>
They can also be found in random.<hr>

How to find out that the program has found the key?</br>

A message about the find will appear in the program window.</br>
The program will also write the address and key to the text file FOUND.txt</br>
If a telegram bot is connected, it will send you a message.<hr>

How to create a bot and get id ?</br>

Find information on the Internet.<hr>

Why did the program open the browser?</br>

Sending API telegram bot requests goes only through the browser.<hr>

What is the chance to find?</br>

Just like winning the lottery.<hr>

Is this theft?

This is a very controversial issue!</br>
Almost all coins are lost.</br>
Coins (Serie1) are 12 years old, with a high rate of bitcoin, they were not used.</br>
Or do you think that the owner of the coin is waiting for the rate to fall at all?</br>
If you find a gold coin on the beach (in a landfill)?</br>
Is this theft or a find?</br>
After all, the found coin has (was) an owner, you didnâ€™t physically steal it.</br>
It's just that the lost coin has a new owner.</br>
As the unspoken rule of bitcoin says:</br>
Whoever has the private key is the owner.</br>
Try to find it first :-)<hr>

If I find a large amount (more than 1 btc), what are the guarantees that I will receive my 50%?

At the moment there is no way to give you a guarantee.</br>
Suggest your way.</br>
The payment is based on trust.</br>
If the amount is large and there is no trust, you can fly to Belarus Minsk and meet in person.</br>
Import and send coins will be in your presence at the hotel.<hr>

What is rated speed?</br>

The RTX 3090 can process max 180,000,000 minikeys (private keys) per second.</br>
Since invalid private keys after validation ? == 00 are skipped, which increases the speed.</br>
Example</br>
10,000,000,000 (mini-keys) private keys were processed, of which only</br>
180,000,000 turned out to be valid and went through the full cycle of the private key -> address algorithm.</br>
The remaining 9,820,000,000 were skipped in the first stage.</br>
For clarity, let's take a minikey</br>
SkK5VPtmTm3mQKYaJQFRZP his private key f30c1ddd12ea91bd35d5d1b83eac611717d99da826f207c3c3d4839e271648cb</br>
To check the validity of the minikey, you need to add "?"</br>
SkK5VPtmTm3mQKYaJQFRZP? -> sha256 = 00442b142a40eefcd894b0bb6f19c58284f2e7248cee7e4910cd37afbfc7879a</br>
If the output private key starts with 00...., then</br>
The minikey (without the ?) is valid and needs to be processed.</br>
If you change one letter of the minikey and add "?" you don't get a private key that starts with 00....</br>
According to statistics, only 1 key out of 50-60 will be valid.<hr>

When FOUND is triggered, the last position of the minikey is visible.</br>
I will pass in Fialka M-125 7 characters and will not share with you.</br>

The toolbar displays a part of the random key that is not included in the search.</br>
This was done for the visual process of the program.<hr>

I didn't find the answer to my question<hr>
